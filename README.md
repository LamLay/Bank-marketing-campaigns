# Bank-marketing-campaigns

Successful businesses need to gather information about clients to find the best-selling products
and target the right customers. In this paper, I will explore and analyze a dataset that describes
Portugal bank marketing campaigns results. This dataset can be found in the UCI Machine
Learning Repository and Kaggle. The campaigns were mostly done via direct phone calls, and
their goals are to convince the customers to place a bank term deposit. From this dataset, I will
find important variables that affect the outcome of the campaign and develop two machine
learning models to predict whether a client will subscribe a bank term deposit or not. Because the
target is binary (“Yes” and “No”), this is a classification problem. In this paper, I will use
Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models to predict the target and compare their predictive
results.
